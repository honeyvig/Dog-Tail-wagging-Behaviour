# Dog-Tail-wagging-Behaviour
The ideal candidate has experience with computer vision, transfer learning, and model fine-tuning. In addition to using the data we provide, you’ll also be responsible for sourcing relevant dog tail-wagging videos and datasets online to strengthen the model’s accuracy and adaptability.

Responsibilities:
- Develop the initial model (4-6 weeks): Start with a prebuilt or pre-trained model and customize it to interpret dog tail-wagging behaviors for emotional insights.
- Train and Fine-Tune: Use transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques to train the model on a combination of our data and relevant data sourced online.
- Data Sourcing and Augmentation: Locate and integrate additional data from publicly available sources (e.g., Creative Commons-licensed videos) to supplement our dataset and improve model performance.
- Ongoing Data Integration: Work with us over time to incorporate new data into the model, improving accuracy and adaptability.
- Implement Data Processing Pipelines: Set up data processing and labeling workflows that allow us to periodically add new labeled data.
- Optimize Model for Deployment: Ensure the model can be optimized for mobile deployment (e.g., using TensorFlow Lite or CoreML) for real-time performance on mobile devices.
- Collaborate on Continual Learning: Help design and implement a retraining schedule or online learning strategy, allowing the model to improve over time.

Requirements:
- Proven experience in AI/ML development with a focus on computer vision and video analysis.
- Strong knowledge of transfer learning and pre-trained model adaptation (e.g., YOLO, TensorFlow, OpenCV).
- Familiarity with TensorFlow Lite or CoreML for optimizing models for mobile.
- Experience with data sourcing and integration from online sources, including understanding of copyright and Creative Commons usage.
- Knowledge of data processing and labeling workflows, including data augmentation techniques to expand datasets.
- Experience with cloud services (Google Cloud, AWS, Azure) for model training and ongoing updates.
- Strong communication skills, with the ability to work closely with non-technical team members over time.
=======================
Here's Python code for developing and training a machine learning model to interpret dog tail-wagging behavior. The code uses TensorFlow and OpenCV for video analysis and leverages a pre-trained model with transfer learning for efficient development.
Code for Initial Model Development
Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries

pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib scikit-learn

Step 2: Load Pre-Trained Model (e.g., MobileNetV2)

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
import numpy as np
import cv2

# Load pre-trained MobileNetV2 model without the top layers
base_model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)

# Add custom layers for tail-wagging behavior classification
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dropout(0.3)(x)
x = Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = Dense(3, activation='softmax')  # Example: [Happy, Neutral, Aggressive]

# Define the new model
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Freeze the base model layers
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

Step 3: Data Preparation

    Prepare labeled datasets for different tail-wagging behaviors (Happy, Neutral, Aggressive).
    Use data augmentation to enrich the dataset.

# Data augmentation and preprocessing
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1.0 / 255,
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    validation_split=0.2
)

train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'data/tail_wagging',
    target_size=(224, 224),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='categorical',
    subset='training'
)

validation_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'data/tail_wagging',
    target_size=(224, 224),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='categorical',
    subset='validation'
)

Step 4: Compile and Train the Model

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    epochs=10,
    validation_data=validation_generator
)

Step 5: Fine-Tune the Model

Unfreeze some layers of the base model for fine-tuning.

# Unfreeze layers in the base model
for layer in base_model.layers[-50:]:
    layer.trainable = True

# Recompile with a lower learning rate
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.0001),
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Continue training
history_fine_tune = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    epochs=10,
    validation_data=validation_generator
)

Step 6: Video Analysis for Tail-Wagging Detection

def analyze_video(video_path, model, target_size=(224, 224)):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    while cap.isOpened():
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        # Preprocess frame
        resized_frame = cv2.resize(frame, target_size)
        normalized_frame = resized_frame / 255.0
        input_frame = np.expand_dims(normalized_frame, axis=0)

        # Predict behavior
        prediction = model.predict(input_frame)
        predicted_class = np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)
        print(f"Predicted Class: {predicted_class}")

        # Display frame
        cv2.imshow('Frame', frame)
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Step 7: Deploy Model for Mobile Use

    Convert the model for deployment using TensorFlow Lite.

# Convert model to TensorFlow Lite
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()

# Save the model
with open('dog_tail_wagging_model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)

Next Steps:

    Ongoing Refinement:
        Continuously collect and label new tail-wagging videos for retraining.
        Implement active learning pipelines.

    Mobile Integration:
        Use TensorFlow Lite for real-time mobile deployment.

    Cloud Deployment:
        Deploy the model to Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure for robust data processing.

This framework will get you started with a scalable solution for detecting dog tail-wagging behavior.
